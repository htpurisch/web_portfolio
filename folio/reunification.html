            <p class = "txtemiss"> I made this map for an assignment to make a choropleth map with normalized data. 
                My main motivation for choosing the case was the time I spent in a small village in the northern German 
                Federal State of Niedersachsen. 
               I was only a short drive from where the Wall once stood. I was really interested in the stories of my host family's friends that went against the narratives you typically heard about reunification in America,
                that everyone wanted out of the East and were simply overjoyed to become absorbed into the West. Hearing my neighbors speak on the isssue, I realized that it was extremely complicated and undertaken in a way where many Easterners felt like they were left behind.
                This map tries to show some existing disparities between East and West.
