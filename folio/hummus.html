                I was motivated to tell a visual story about hummus and the Arab-Israeli 
                conflict after watching a German film titled Mazel-Tov Cocktail which briefly mentioned ‘Hummus Wars’ between Arabic and Israeli people. I dug more into the story and learned that in the 2010s Lebanon and Israel traded off world record attempts for the world’s largest dish of hummus. I thought this provided an interesting insight into the Arab-Israeli conflict and I wanted to create a visual story based on it. I utilized Arc Story Maps to make a long-form infographic that told of the hummus wars from both a cultural and economic point of view. In doing so, I tried to also frame it in terms of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.
